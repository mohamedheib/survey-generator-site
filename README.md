  About the project:
  
  TGS: test generator site

Main issue:
  As we all can see nowadays all the education industry has become more complicated, 
  and hard either to students and teachers since covid-19 appeared in our life.
  one of the many problems that covid-19 has exposed is the remote exams  which requires from 
  the teachers so many efforts to prepare them  and test these exams. 
 
  TGS (test generator site) is a website that comes to assist teachers /users who 	
  want to create a survey/test and share it with their students, friends, coworkers, or any other users.
  
Why TGS?
  TGS has been designed to be pretty easy and require almost 0% knowledge in technology, this design was
  introduced to fit both teachers that have a weak knowledge in technology and those that have good knowledge.
